- **The Repository** refers to the Elypso Hub source code repository and all content it contains.

## 1. Scope

This license applies to all source code, binaries and assets contained in the **Repository** with the following exceptions, including but not limited to:
    
- `/files`  
- `/_external_shared`  

Each of these directories may contain libraries or files licensed under their own separate licenses, whether or not they were created by the **Company**. If a directory contains a separate license, that license governs the directory and all of its subdirectories, and this license does not apply to that content.  

All remaining content in the **Repository** is the property of the **Company** and is covered by this license.

## 2. Free Use

You are free to download, install, and use the **Project Manager** for the purpose of creating **User-Created Works**.  
You retain all rights and ownership to **User-Created Works**.  
You do not owe the **Company** any fees or royalties upon publishing, selling, or otherwise distributing **User-Created Works** that were made with the **Project Manager**.

## 3. No Commercial Transfer

You may not sell, sublicense, redistribute, or otherwise commercially transfer the **Project Manager** itself, or any part of the **Repository** including its source code, binaries, or bundled assets covered by this license.  
This restriction applies regardless of whether modifications have been made.  
Commercial distribution is only permitted for **User-Created Works**.

## 4. Modification and Attribution (For Distributed Versions)

You may modify the **Repository** for personal or internal use.  
If you share modified versions of the **Repository** (including forks or public distributions), you must:  
- Include clear attribution to the **Project Manager** and the **Company** as the developer of the **Project Manager**.  
- Retain all copyright and license notices.  
- Make clear that your version is modified and not the official **Project Manager**.

## 5. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

The **Repository** and the **Project Manager** are provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.  
In no event shall the **Company** or any contributor to the **Repository** be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the use of the **Repository**, the **Project Manager**, or any **User-Created Work**.

## 6. Termination

This license terminates automatically if you fail to comply with its terms.  
Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the **Project Manager** and the **Repository**, but may continue to use and distribute **User-Created Works** you created prior to termination.
