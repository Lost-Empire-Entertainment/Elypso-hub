# Elypso hub

**Elypso hub** is the project launcher used by Elypso engine. It uses several libraries listed in [the library file](LIBRARIES.md), it is built with C++ 20 and it runs natively on Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu-based distros and Arch).

**Elypso hub** is considered to be in a stable state, most of the features are functional but a full 2.0 rewrite is coming in the near future.

The documentation for **Elypso hub** will be found at the [website](https://elypsoengine.com)  in the near future so please look there for information, this README file will not cover how to install or use this program.
